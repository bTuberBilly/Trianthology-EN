WIP English Patch for the 07th Expansion Game "Trianthology" by Billy, the Analog vTuber Bass

## Installation

This patch requires a legitimate copy of Trianthology to be installed on your machine.

To install the patch, simply download the file labeled `0.txt` and place it in the root of your game directory. NScripter2 automatically looks for this file to parse before it looks for `00.ns2`.

## Misc. Info

I tried running this on Steam Deck, and it fails to parse the file. This may or may not be related to how line endings differ between Windows and Linux, but I'm not sure yet. Just consider it Windows-only for now.

The patch names are just made up by me. Since I'm releasing updates chapter-by-chapter, I figured it would be fun to name them like Higurashi chapters. ðŸ˜Š The first one is the "Boredom-Killing Arc".
